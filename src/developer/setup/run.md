# Run the project

ðŸª§ Now that the codebase is set up, you are ready to run the application.

1. If you are using **VS Code**, please refer to the [Run with VSCode](run-with-vscode.md) guide.
2. If you are not using an IDE and prefer to work directly with a text editor, please refer to the [Run without IDE](run-without-ide.md) guide.

   Note: With this approach, you wonâ€™t have access to integrated debugging features provided by full IDEs.
