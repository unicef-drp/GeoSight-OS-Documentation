# Configuration

In this step, you'll update some files to get the project working â€” but donâ€™t worry, most of it is automated.
All you need to do is:

1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

> ðŸª§ Now that the codebase is set up, youâ€™re ready to run the application. Continue to the [Run Guide](run/index.md).
You may also want to review how to set up other environments before running the project.


## Set up different environment (optional)
To set up different environment, for example the Default credential, or the port of server, open **deployment/.env**.
You can check the description below for each of variable.

```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=geosight
