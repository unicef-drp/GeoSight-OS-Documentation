## Configuration

In this step, you'll update some files to get the project working â€” but donâ€™t worry, most of it is automated! All you need to do is:

1. Navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

> ğŸª§ Now that the codebase is set up, youâ€™re ready to run the application. Continue to the [run guide](run/index.md).

You may also want to review how to set up other environments (see below) before running the project.

### Set up different environment (optional)

To edit the application settings (e.g. username of admin user, password of admin user, port of server etc.), use a text editor to edit **deployment/.env**. See the descriptions below for each of variable.

One thing to note is that there is a plugin framework which allows you to extend GeoSight-OS with additional features. You can enable or disable plugins in the **deployment/.env** file too. See [the developer plugins manual](../../manual/plugins.md) for more details.

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=geosight
NGINX_TAG=0.0.1  
DJANGO_TAG=3.0.0 

# Environments
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.prod 
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin #-> Default admin username 
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin #-> Default admin password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com #-> Default admin email
INITIAL_FIXTURES=True
HTTP_PORT=80 #-> Change the port of nginx

# Database Environment
DATABASE_NAME=django #-> Default database name
DATABASE_USERNAME=docker #-> Default database username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=docker #-> Default database password
DATABASE_HOST=db #-> Default database host. Change this if you use cloud database or any new docker container.
RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq

# --------------------------------
# ---------- APP DOMAIN ----------
# Required for tenant configurations
APP_DOMAIN=localhost #-> The main domain for the application for tenants

# -------------------------------
# ---------- PLUGINS ------------
# Specify the plugins to enable or disable
# Use a comma-separated list

# GeoSight plugins:
# - tenants
# - cloud_native_gis
# - reference_dataset
# - machine_info_fetcher
PLUGINS=cloud_native_gis,reference_dataset -> Use comma separator for activate plugins
# -----------------------------
```
