## Demo data

### Run demo data

GeoSight has demo data that can be restored to help you test the application and see how it works with sample data.

To restore demo data, use the dev container terminal to navigate to the Django project directory and run the fixtures by using the following commands:

```bash
cd /home/web/django_project/
python manage.py load_demo_data
```

> ğŸª§ More advanced setups can use **GeoRepo** to manage administrative boundaries. To set this up, refer to the [GeoRepo Guide](georepo.md).
