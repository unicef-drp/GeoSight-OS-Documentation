# Demo data

## Run demo data

GeoSight has demo data that can be restored.

To restore demo data:
```
cd /home/web/django_project/
python manage.py load_demo_data
```

ðŸª§ Now that you have loaded the demo data, you can optionally use **GeoRepo** to manage administrative boundaries.
To set it up, refer to the [GeoRepo Guide](georepo.md).
