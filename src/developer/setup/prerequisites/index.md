# Prerequisites

In this section, we cover any tools that need to be installed on your system so you can set up a local development environment.

To get started, you will need the following installed on your system:

- **Docker** — Required for running containers and setting up the environment easily.
- **Git** — Required for cloning the repository and version control.

You can then follow the appropriate setup guide based on your operating system:

- **[Windows](./os-windows.md):** Step-by-step guide for setting up the development environment on Windows.
- **[Linux](./os-linux.md):** Step-by-step guide for setting up the development environment on Linux.
