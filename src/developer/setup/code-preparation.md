```

ðŸª§ Now that the codebase is set up, you are ready to run the application.

1. If you are using **VS Code**, please refer to the [Run with VSCode](run-with-vscode.md) guide.
2. If you are using **PyCharm**, please refer to the [Run with PyCharm](run-with-pycharm.md) guide.
3. If you are not using an IDE and prefer to work directly with a text editor, please refer to the [Run without IDE](run-without-ide.md) guide.
