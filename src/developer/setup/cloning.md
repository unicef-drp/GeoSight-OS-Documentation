# Cloning out the Code

This section outlines the process of checking out the code for local development.

Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

Anonymous Git code check out [https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS.git](https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS.git)

```
git clone -b deployment --single-branch https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS.git
```

Alternatively check out over ssh:

```
git clone -b deployment --single-branch git@github.com:unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS.git
```

ðŸ“’**Which branch to use?**: Note that we deploy our staging work from the `main` branch and our production environment from the release tag. If you are planning on contributing improvements to the project, please submit them against the `main` branch.

ðŸª§ Now that you have the docker and cloned the project, move on to the [Step 3 - code preparation](code-preparation.md).
