# GeoSight Plugin

GeoSight has several plugins available for use.
By default, these plugins are inactive.
To enable them, you can modify the environment variable PLUGINS.

_Environments:_

```
# Required for tenant configurations
APP_DOMAIN=localhost

# Specify the plugins to enable or disable
# Use a comma-separated list

# GeoSight plugins:
# - tenants
# - cloud_native_gis
# - reference_dataset
# - machine_info_fetcher
PLUGINS=cloud_native_gis,reference_dataset
# -----------------------------
```

## 1. Tenants

The Tenants plugin (tenants) enables GeoSight to support multiple applications across
different domains. Each tenant has its own domain and stores its data in a
separate schema.

When enabling the tenants plugin, the APP_DOMAIN environment variable must be
configured. APP_DOMAIN represents the domain used by the main application.

For example:

```
If the domain is geosight.example.com, set APP_DOMAIN=geosight.example.
If the domain is example.com, set APP_DOMAIN=example.
```

For more details about tenants, refer to the
documentation: [Django Tenants Documentation](https://django-tenants.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## 2. Cloud Native GIS

Cloud Native GIS plugin (cloud_native_gis) is a feature in GeoSight that allows users to upload their own
GIS files as context layers.
Currently, only vector layers are supported, but raster layer support will be
added in the future.

In GeoSight, a new type of context layer, "Cloud Native GIS Layer," has been
introduced.
When selected, additional details will appear below, displaying an upload form
for the file.

style._

For more details about tenants, refer to
the [github repository](https://github.com/kartoza/CloudNativeGIS/).

## 3. Reference Dataset

The Reference Dataset plugin (reference_dataset) serves as a local version of GeoRepo, i.e. allow GeoSight users to upload reference polygon layers (e.g. national boundaries, provinces or districts) directly within GeoSight, without relying on a remote connection to GeoRepo.

Users can upload their own vector files, similar to GeoRepo, which can then be
used as a reference view in GeoSight.

_Image 4. If activated, a 'Local' tab will appear, allowing users to utilize
the local reference datasets._

_Image 5. If activated, new view type options will be displayed as a tab._
