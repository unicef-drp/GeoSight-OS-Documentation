# Checking out the Code

This section outlines the process of checking out the code for local development.

ðŸš© Make sure you have gone through the [Prerequisites Section](prerequisites.md) before following these notes.


Ananymous Git code check out  https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS.git

```
git clone https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS.git
```

Alternatively check out over ssh:

```
git clone git@github.com:unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS.git
```

Once the code is checked out, you can open it in VSCode by doing the following:

```
cd GeoSight-OS
code .
```


ðŸ“’**Which branch to use?**: Note that we deploy our staging work from the `develop` branch and our production environment from the `main` branch. If you are planning on contributing improvements to the project, please submit them against the `develop` branch.


ðŸª§ Now that you have the code checked out, move on to the [IDE Setup](ide-setup.md) documentation.
