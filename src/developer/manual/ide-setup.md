# Setting up your IDE

This section outlines the process for configuring your IDE for development.

üö© Make sure you have gone through the [Cloning Section](cloning.md) before following these notes.
## VS Code Setup

**Note for Apple Silicon**
Before proceeding with the setup, if you are developing on an Apple Silicon or other AMD-based devices, please ensure to uncomment line 17 in the [deployment/docker/Dockerfile](https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS/blob/main/deployment/docker/Dockerfile#L17).

```
#ARG PLATFORM=linux/arm64
```
 
Open the project in VSCode (1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£) by navigating the the place on your file system where you checked out the code in the pre-requisites step above (3Ô∏è‚É£).

![image.png](./img/ide-setup-1.png)

Accept the 'trust authors' prompt

![image.png](./img/ide-setup-2.png)

### Install necessary extension

Before proceeding, please ensure that the necessary extension is installed. 
Navigate to the Extensions panel (1), then search for and install the DevContainers extension (2).

![image.png](./img/ide-setup-7.png)


### Copying the .env

Copy the `template.env` to `.env`
![image.png](./img/ide-setup-3.png)
Edit the `.env` file and change the 

```
SECRET_KEY=SECRET_KEY
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.prod
```
to   

```
SECRET_KEY=<Random text as it is the secret key of app>
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=core.settings.dev
```

Make sure that `SECRET_KEY` is not empty.

![image.png](./img/ide-setup-4.png)

### Override Docker Configs
We are going to copy the docker overrides template to a local file that will not be under version control.

![image.png](./img/ide-setup-5.png)

Rename the file to `docker-compose.override.yml`

![image.png](./img/ide-setup-6.png)

Initially you will not need to change anything in this file, though you may want to take a look through the various configurations provided here if you want to tweak your local setup.


Now that you have your IDE set up, we can move on to [building the project](building.md).



## Using pycharm


üìí ‚õîÔ∏è This section needs to be reviewed and organised into our docs framework.

This section is for using pycharm.

Requirements:

- Pycharm
- Finished **Setting up the project**

## Setup interpreter

1. Go to file -> setting -> Project -> Project Interpreter -> click cog -> add
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/1.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

2. Go to ssh interpreter -> Fill the form like below
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/2.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

3. Click next and fill **docker** as password
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/3.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

4. Click next and change interpreter like below and click finish
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/4.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

5. After finish, it will show all package like below.
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/5.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

6. In current page, click **path mappings**, click + button and put local path to where the project (django-project folder) and remote path is like below. and click oK.
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/6.png "Project Interpreter")

Now the interpreter is done. When we restart the machine, we need to do `make up` to run the project.

## Setup run configuration

After the interpreter is done, we need configuration to run the project in development mode.

1. Click "Add configuration" like in the cursor in the image below. (top-right)
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/7.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

2. There will be a popup, and click +, then click **django server** like below
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/8.png "Project Interpreter")
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/9.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

3. It will show the form and fill like below.
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/10.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

4. Don't click the OK yet, but click **Environment Variables** and add environments like below 9by clicking + button).
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/11.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

5. After that, click OK.

6. Now we need to run the server by clicking **go** button in below image.
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/12.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

7. When we click the **go** button, pycharm will run a process until like image below.
   <br>![Project Interpreter ](img/13.png "Project Interpreter")<br><br>

8. Now it is done. We can access the development server in [http://localhost:2000/](http://localhost:2000/)

This development mode is DEBUG mode, and also whenever we change the code, the site will also change in runtime.

## Quick Setup Guide

‚õîÔ∏èüìí This content needs to be reviewed and moved to the readme.

### Production

```
git clone https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight
cd GeoSight/deployment
docker-compose up -d
```

The web will be available at `http://127.0.0.1/`

To stop containers:

```
docker-compose kill
```

To stop and delete containers:

```
docker-compose down
```

### Development

```
git clone https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS
cd GeoSight-OS/deployment
cp .template.env .env
cp docker-compose.override.template.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

After that, do
- open new terminal
- on folder root of project, do
```
make frontend-dev
```
Wait until it is done
when there is sentence "webpack xxx compiled successfully in xxx ms".<br>
After that, don't close the terminal.
If it is accidentally closed, do `make frontend-dev` again

Next step:
- Open new terminal
- Do commands below
```
make up
docker logs -f geosight_django
```

wait until it says
```
*** Operational MODE: preforking ***
WSGI app 0 (mountpoint='') ready in 1 seconds on interpreter 0x55e78f7927d0 pid: 1 (default app)
uWSGI running as root, you can use --uid/--gid/--chroot options
*** WARNING: you are running uWSGI as root !!! (use the --uid flag) *** 
*** uWSGI is running in multiple interpreter mode ***
spawned uWSGI master process (pid: 1)
spawned uWSGI worker 1 (pid: 194, cores: 1)
spawned uWSGI worker 2 (pid: 195, cores: 1)
unable to stat() /tmp/touch-me-to-reload, events will be triggered as soon as the file is created
```

After that, do below commands:
```
ctrl + c
make dev
```
or on new terminal
```
make dev
```

Wait until it is done.

The web can be accessed using `http://localhost:2000/`

If the web is taking long time to load, restart geosight_dev container by `make dev-reload`.<br>
The sequence should be `make frontend-dev`, after that run or restart geosight_dev. 

To stop dev:

```
make dev-kill
```

To reload container:

```
make dev-reload
```
