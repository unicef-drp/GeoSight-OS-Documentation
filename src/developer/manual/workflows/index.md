# Developer Workflows

In this section of the documentation, we explain how to work with workflows, examples of typical workflows for adding features, fixing bugs etc:

* **[Github Workflow](./github.md)** Here, we present the documentation workflow for creating a new feature or reporting a bug. 
* **[End to End Test Workflow](./end-to-end-test.md)** Here, we present the documentation workflow for interacting with end-to-end tests to ensure the frontend functions correctly.
